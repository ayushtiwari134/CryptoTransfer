<h1>CryptoTransfer</h1>

My first end-to-end Web3.0 project.
This is a fully responsive web3.0 application which can be used to transfer cryptocurrencies (example ETH) from one address to another.
<br>

`You must have a metamask account to connect to the wallet and then transfer funds.`
<br>

The app has currently only able to send `goerli` from one account to another but it can be customised to send other currencies as well.

<h1>Working</h1>

~Clicking the `Connect wallet` button will open up a metamask dialog box which will ask you to connect your metamask account.<br>
~You then enter the address of the receiver and the amount you wanna send,<br>
along with a message and a keyword for a gif
`(the last two will be added later.)`
